## Outdoor person, North & South Pole skier

Although strictly thinking this has nothing to do with my professional life, it
still affects me as a person and coworker and thus is hard to leave unmentioned.
I have done lots of sports in my life, and quite a lot of nice trips around the
world. The ultimatum of this all was an unsupported expedition to the North Pole
at 2006 with a group of seven skiers. The old site is still live, you can check
[www.pohjoisnapa.fi](https://www.pohjoisnapa.fi) if you want to learn more.
Honorable mention is [South Pole expedition](https://3poles.fi) during season
2022-23. This trip was also unsupported and took 52 days of skiing.
